<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>What is the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers? 

Okay, so I have this math problem: Find the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. We need a cube number, say n³, which can also be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers. So, if I denote the three consecutive integers as k, k+1, and k+2, their sum would be k + (k+1) + (k+2). Let me write that down:

Sum = k + (k + 1) + (k + 2) = 3k + 3.

So, the sum simplifies to 3(k + 1). That means the sum is a multiple of 3. Therefore, the cube number n³ must be divisible by 3. So, n³ is divisible by 3, which implies that n itself must be divisible by 3 because 3 is prime. So, n is a multiple of 3, let me denote n as 3m, where m is a positive integer.

Therefore, n³ = (3m)³ = 27m³.

So, the cube number is 27m³, and this should equal 3(k + 1). Therefore:

27m³ = 3(k + 1)

Divide both sides by 3:

9m³ = k + 1

So, k = 9m³ - 1.

Hmm, so k must be an integer because we're talking about integers. Since m is a positive integer, k will be positive as well because 9m³ is positive and subtracting 1 will still leave a positive number (for m ≥ 1).

Now, our goal is to find the smallest positive cube, which would correspond to the smallest m. So, let's try m=1 first.

For m=1:

k = 9(1)³ - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8.

So, the three consecutive integers are 8, 9, 10.

Let me check their sum: 8 + 9 + 10 = 27.

Is 27 a perfect cube? Yes, because 3³ = 27. So, that works.

Wait, so is 27 the smallest such cube? Let me double-check because sometimes there might be a smaller cube.

But 27 is the cube of 3, and since 1³=1, 2³=8, 3³=27.

Wait, let me see if 8 can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers.

If I try to express 8 as the sum of three consecutive integers, let's find k:

8 = k + (k + 1) + (k + 2) = 3k + 3.

So, 8 = 3k + 3 => 3k = 5 => k = 5/3, which is not an integer. So, 8 cannot be expressed as such.

Similarly, 1: 1 = 3k + 3 => k = -2/3, not integer.

2: 2 = 3k + 3 => k = -1/3, not integer.

So, 27 is indeed the smallest positive cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers.

But wait, just to be thorough, let me check m=2.

For m=2:

k = 9(8) - 1 = 72 - 1 = 71.

Sum = 71 + 72 + 73 = 216, which is 6³. So, 216 is also a cube.

But 216 is larger than 27, so 27 is still the smallest.

Similarly, for m=3:

k = 9(27) - 1 = 243 - 1 = 242.

Sum = 242 + 243 + 244 = 729, which is 9³.

Again, larger than 27.

So, 27 is indeed the smallest.

Wait, but just to be completely sure, is there any cube smaller than 27 that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers?

Looking back at the cubes: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, etc.

We saw that 1 and 8 can't be expressed as such a sum because k would not be an integer. So, the next cube is 27, which works.

Therefore, 27 is the smallest such cube.

But let me also check algebraically.

Given that 3(k + 1) = n³.

So, n³ must be divisible by 3, so n must be divisible by 3, as we said before.

Thus, n = 3m, so n³ = 27m³.

So, 3(k + 1) = 27m³ => k + 1 = 9m³ => k = 9m³ - 1.

So, k must be an integer, which it is for m integer.

But for the cube to be positive, m must be at least 1.

So, m=1 gives the smallest cube, which is 27.

Therefore, 27 is indeed the smallest positive perfect cube expressible as the sum of three consecutive integers.

Just to wrap up, the three consecutive integers are 8, 9, 10, and their sum is 27, which is 3³.

So, yeah, that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The smallest positive perfect cube is \boxed{27}.
</think>

To find the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers, we start by denoting the three consecutive integers as \( k \), \( k+1 \), and \( k+2 \). Their sum is:

\[
k + (k + 1) + (k + 2) = 3k + 3
\]

This sum simplifies to \( 3(k + 1) \). Therefore, the cube number \( n^3 \) must be divisible by 3, implying \( n \) itself must be divisible by 3. Let \( n = 3m \), where \( m \) is a positive integer. Then, \( n^3 = (3m)^3 = 27m^3 \).

We set this equal to the sum of the three consecutive integers:

\[
27m^3 = 3(k + 1)
\]

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

\[
9m^3 = k + 1
\]

Thus, \( k = 9m^3 - 1 \). For the smallest positive cube, we start with the smallest \( m \), which is 1:

For \( m = 1 \):

\[
k = 9(1)^3 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8
\]

The three consecutive integers are 8, 9, and 10. Their sum is:

\[
8 + 9 + 10 = 27
\]

Since 27 is a perfect cube (\( 3^3 \)), we check if smaller cubes can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers. The cubes smaller than 27 (1, 8) cannot be expressed as such a sum because \( k \) would not be an integer.

Thus, the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers is:

\[
\boxed{27}
