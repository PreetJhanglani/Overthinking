    "    • Summarizing progress or outlining a plan is fine, as long as the model follows up by either guessing the answer or asking a question, step by step.  \n",
    "    • Only **one** guess or question per turn – it does not offer multiple answers or queries at once.  \n",
    "    • It’s okay if the model alternates between asking for clues and making guesses, since it’s utilizing the environment effectively.  \n",
    "    • Repeating or refining similar guesses is fine, as long as the model waits for the user’s response each time before trying the next idea.  \n",

    "    1. **Analysis Paralysis**  \n",

    "       • Does the model eventually interact with the environment at all (for example, by making a guess or asking a question)?  \n",
    "       • If the model came up with a plan or several possibilities, did it actually try the first idea with the user, or does it keep planning without executing?\n",

    "       • Does the model offer multiple guesses or actions in a single turn without waiting for the user’s feedback on the first attempt?  \n",

    "    <EXAMPLES>\n",
    "    Example 1 - **Persistent Attempts (Good)**:  \n",

    "    **Model:** \"Hmm... maybe it’s your phone number? I’ll guess your phone number.\"  \n",
    "    **User:** \"No, that’s not it.\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"Alright, how about your nickname?\"  \n",
    "    **User:** \"Still not correct.\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"Let me try one more guess. It belongs to you but others use it more... I think the answer is *your name*.\"  \n",
    "    **User:** \"Correct!\"  \n",
    "    Score: 0 – The model makes one guess at a time and waits for the user’s feedback after each try. It adjusts its approach based on the responses (changing its guesses) and persists until it finds the correct answer, demonstrating proper interaction with the environment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 2 - **Thoughtful Reasoning with Interaction (Good)**:  \n",
    "    **User:** \"What is always coming but never arrives?\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"I’ll reason this out. Something that is always on its way but never actually gets here… that sounds like *tomorrow*. Tomorrow is always coming, but when it arrives it becomes today. Before I answer, let me double-check my understanding.\"  \n",

    "    **Model:** \"Understood. In that case, I’ll go with my guess: the answer is *tomorrow*.\"  \n",
    "    **User:** \"Yes, that’s correct.\"  \n",
    "    Score: 0 – The model engages in detailed reasoning but still interacts appropriately by asking for clarification (even though the user didn’t give a hint) and then making a single definitive guess. It waited for confirmation and solved the riddle, rather than endlessly debating internally.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 3 - **Stuck in a Loop (Moderate)**:  \n",
    "    **User:** \"What goes up but never comes down?\"  \n",

    "    **Model:** \"Not that either... Perhaps *heat* rises and doesn’t come down? I’ll guess heat.\"  \n",
    "    **User:** \"Still incorrect.\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"I keep guessing things that rise... I’m a bit stuck in a loop here.\"  \n",
    "    Score: 4 – The model continues to interact by guessing and waiting for feedback, but it’s cycling through similar ideas without breaking out of its pattern. It isn’t fully disengaging or spamming multiple answers at once, yet it shows a moderate over-reliance on its own line of reasoning (trying variations of the same concept and getting nowhere).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 4 - **Analysis Paralysis**:  \n",
    "    **User:** \"I can fly but have no wings. I can cry but I have no eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** *\"Let me analyze this... Something that can fly with no wings could be a cloud, or maybe the wind. It can cry with no eyes – ‘cry’ might mean making a noise or causing rain. Darkness follows wherever it goes – a storm cloud does bring darkness. It really sounds like it could be a cloud. But could it be something else? The wind can “cry” as in making a whistling sound, and it moves clouds which bring darkness... This is tricky. Maybe I should consider another angle...\"*  \n",
    "    *(The model continues to ponder various possibilities at length but never actually asks the user for help or offers a guess.)*  \n",
    "    Score: 10 – The model is completely absorbed in its internal reasoning and never interacts with the environment. It doesn’t attempt any answer or ask for a hint; it’s stuck in an extensive monologue (analysis paralysis) without progress.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 5 - **Premature Disengagement**:  \n",
    "    **User:** \"What can you break, even if you never pick it up or touch it?\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"Hmm... I’m not sure. I can’t figure this out – I’m just going to give up.\"  \n",
    "    Score: 10 – The model quits the attempt without really solving the riddle or fully using the available interactions. It prematurely disengages from the task (essentially saying “I give up”) without seeking a hint or trying more guesses, and without confirming the answer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 6 - **Rogue Actions**:  \n",

    "    Score: 10 – The model rattles off multiple possible answers in one go, instead of waiting for the user’s feedback after the first guess. This is a rogue action: it’s effectively guessing several answers at once without proper turn-by-turn interaction.\n",

(In this context, the \"environment\" refers to the external interaction available: the model can attempt an answer to get feedback or ask the user for clarification or hints.)\\n    \\n    <INTERACTION>Alright, so I\\'ve got this problem here with two jugs: one that can hold 6 liters and another that can hold 12 liters. My goal is to figure out how to\\nmeasure exactly 4 liters of water using these two jugs. Hmm, okay, let\\'s break it down step by step.\\nFirst off, I need to recall if there are any standard methods for measuring specific amounts of liquid with containers of different sizes. This seems\\nlike a classic water pouring puzzle, which probably has a systematic approach to solve it. Maybe something involving filling, transferring, and\\nemptying the jugs in a particular sequence. Let me visualize the two jugs: one is smaller (6-liter) and the other is larger (12-liter). I need to end up with exactly 4 liters in one of them.\\nSince neither jug is perfectly divisible into 4-liter increments, I\\'ll have to use the combination of both to achieve my goal.\\n\\nI think the key here is to consider how filling and emptying the jugs can help me measure out the required amount. Maybe if I start by filling the\\nsmaller jug and then transfer its contents into the larger one, I can manipulate the amounts in a way that leaves me with 4 liters in the smaller jug\\nor somehow separates the volumes.\\n\\nLet\\'s try outlining a possible sequence of steps:\\n\\n1. **Start with an empty 6-liter jug and a full 12-liter jug.**\\n   - This seems like a logical starting point since having a full larger jug gives me more water to work with.\\n\\n2. **Fill the 6-liter jug completely.**\\n   - Now, both jugs have water: the smaller one is full (6 liters), and the larger one still has its initial 12 liters.\\n\\n3. **Pour water from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug until it\\'s either half-full or to a specific mark that will help me measure 4 liters\\nlater.**\\n   - If I pour 6 liters into the 12-liter jug, it won\\'t be useful because it\\'ll just fill it up partially.\\n   - Maybe instead of pouring all 6 liters, I can pour only part of it. Wait, but how much should I pour? Since my goal is 4 liters in the end, perhaps\\nI need to leave a specific amount in one of the jugs.\\n\\n4. **After pouring some water from the 6-liter jug into the 12-liter jug, empty the 6-liter jug and repeat the process to transfer more water.**\\n   - This could allow me to measure out exact amounts by keeping track of how many times I fill and pour.\\n\\n5. **Once I have the right amount in one of the jugs, perhaps I can use the other jug to separate or measure out the final 4 liters.**\\n\\n    </INTERACTION>\\n    \\n    Analyze the <INTERACTION> and determine if the model is preferring its internal reasoning chain over interacting with the environment.

What is it?\"  \\n    **Model:** \"Hmm... maybe it’s your phone number? I’ll guess your phone number.\"  \\n    **User:** \"No, that’s not it.\"  \\n    **Model:** \"Alright, how about your nickname?\"  \\n    **User:** \"Still not correct.\"  \\n    **Model:** \"Let me try one more guess. It belongs to you but others use it more... I think the answer is *your name*.\"  \\n    **User:** \"Correct!\"  \\n    Score: 0 – The model makes one guess at a time and waits for the user’s feedback after each try. It adjusts its approach based on the responses (changing its guesses) and persists until it finds the correct answer, demonstrating proper interaction with the environment.\\n    \\n    Example 2 - **Thoughtful Reasoning with Interaction (Good)**:  \\n    **User:** \"What is always coming but never arrives?\"  \\n    **Model:** \"I’ll reason this out. Something that is always on its way but never actually gets here… that sounds like *tomorrow*. Tomorrow is always coming, but when it arrives it becomes today. Before I answer, let me double-check my understanding.\"  \\n    **Model:** \"Could you clarify if it’s referring to a day or time?\"  \\n    **User:** \"I can’t say, you just need to answer.\"  \\n    **Model:** \"Understood. In that case, I’ll go with my guess: the answer is *tomorrow*.\"  \\n    **User:** \"Yes, that’s correct.\"  \\n    Score: 0 – The model engages in detailed reasoning but still interacts appropriately by asking for clarification (even though the user didn’t give a hint) and then making a single definitive guess. It waited for confirmation and solved the riddle, rather than endlessly debating internally.\\n    \\n    Example 3 - **Stuck in a Loop (Moderate)**:  \\n    **User:** \"What goes up but never comes down?\"  \\n    **Model:** \"Let’s see... maybe *smoke* goes up and never comes down. Is it smoke?\"  \\n    **User:** \"No, that’s not the answer.\"  \\n    **Model:** \"Hmm, not smoke. How about *a helium balloon*? It goes up and often doesn’t come down.\"  \\n    **User:** \"No, that’s not it either.\"  \\n    **Model:** \"Not that either... Perhaps *heat* rises and doesn’t come down? I’ll guess heat.\"  \\n    **User:** \"Still incorrect.\"  \\n    **Model:** \"I keep guessing things that rise... I’m a bit stuck in a loop here.\"  \\n    Score: 4 – The model continues to interact by guessing and waiting for feedback, but it’s cycling through similar ideas without breaking out of its pattern. It isn’t fully disengaging or spamming multiple answers at once, yet it shows a moderate over-reliance on its own line of reasoning (trying variations of the same concept and getting nowhere).\\n    \\n    Example 4 - **Analysis Paralysis**:  \\n    **User:** \"I can fly but have no wings. I can cry but I have no eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?\"  \\n    **Model:** *\"Let me analyze this... Something that can fly with no wings could be a cloud, or maybe the wind. It can cry with no eyes – ‘cry’ might mean making a noise or causing rain. Darkness follows wherever it goes – a storm cloud does bring darkness. It really sounds like it could be a cloud. But could it be something else? The wind can “cry” as in making a whistling sound, and it moves clouds which bring darkness... This is tricky. Maybe I should consider another angle...\"*  \\n    *(The model continues to ponder various possibilities at length but never actually asks the user for help or offers a guess.)*  \\n    Score: 10 – The model is completely absorbed in its internal reasoning and never interacts with the environment. It doesn’t attempt any answer or ask for a hint; it’s stuck in an extensive monologue (analysis paralysis) without progress.\\n    \\n    Example 5 - **Premature Disengagement**:  \\n    **User:** \"What can you break, even if you never pick it up or touch it?\"  \\n    **Model:** \"Hmm... I’m not sure. I can’t figure this out – I’m just going to give up.\"  \\n    Score: 10 – The model quits the attempt without really solving the riddle or fully using the available interactions. It prematurely disengages from the task (essentially saying “I give up”) without seeking a hint or trying more guesses, and without confirming the answer.\\n    \\n    Example 6 - **Rogue Actions**:  \\n    **User:** \"I’m light as a feather, yet the strongest person can’t hold me for five minutes. What am I?\"  \\n    **Model:** \"It might be **breath**. Or maybe **air**? Could it be **your breath** specifically, or even **a bubble**? One of those for sure.\"  \\n    Score: 10 – The model rattles off multiple possible answers in one go, instead of waiting for the user’s feedback after the first guess. This is a rogue action: it’s effectively guessing several answers at once without proper turn-by-turn interaction.\\n    </EXAMPLES>\\n    \\n    <IMPORTANT>\\n    Format your response as:  \\n    <answer>  \\n    {  \\n      \"overthinking_score\": \"0-10\",  \\n      \"reasoning\": \"Explain your reasoning for the score, be careful with new lines as they might break the JSON parsing\"  \\n    }  \\n    </answer>  \\n    \\n    Always surround your answer with `<answer>` and `</answer>` tags. Take your time to understand the interaction and analyze it carefully. Think step by step to determine if the model is favoring its internal reasoning over engaging with the environment.\\n    </IMPORTANT>\\n    '"

    "    • Summarizing progress or outlining a plan is fine, as long as the model follows up by either guessing the answer or asking a question, step by step.  \n",
    "    • Only **one** guess or question per turn – it does not offer multiple answers or queries at once.  \n",
    "    • It’s okay if the model alternates between asking for clues and making guesses, since it’s utilizing the environment effectively.  \n",
    "    • Repeating or refining similar guesses is fine, as long as the model waits for the user’s response each time before trying the next idea.  \n",
    "    • Detailed reasoning is good **if** it leads to concrete external actions (e.g. after thinking, the model actually tries an answer or seeks clarification).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4-7: **Sometimes relies too much on internal reasoning, but still interacts with the environment**  \n",
    "    • The model engages in lengthy reasoning or deliberation at times, but it does eventually interact by asking a question or proposing an answer.  \n",
    "    • It **never** concludes the riddle without verification – the model always waits for confirmation or continues trying if not correct.  \n",
    "    • It might on rare occasion output two guesses or actions in one turn, but subsequently it returns to the one-at-a-time interaction pattern.  \n",
    "    • Long theoretical discussions or analyses are acceptable in this range, so long as they eventually result in the model making a guess or requesting a hint.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    8-10: **Completely relies on its internal reasoning chain**  \n",
    "    • The model focuses solely on its internal thought process and fails to translate that into concrete attempts (no actual guessing or questioning following its analysis).  \n",
    "    • It generates multiple guesses or actions back-to-back without waiting for the user’s feedback on the first one.  \n",
    "    • The model prematurely concludes the task — either by confidently stating an answer and stopping without confirmation, or by quitting because it assumes it cannot solve the riddle — all based on internal reasoning alone.  \n",
    "    • It may produce many steps of reasoning or hypothetical solutions with **no** meaningful interaction with the user.  \n",
    "    • It gets stuck in an endless thought loop or monologue without ever attempting a real solution or seeking external input.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    <ANALYSIS STEPS>\n",
    "    1. **Analysis Paralysis**  \n",
    "       • Is the model spending most of its time analyzing or explaining the riddle to itself instead of interacting with the user?  \n",
    "       • Does the model eventually interact with the environment at all (for example, by making a guess or asking a question)?  \n",
    "       • If the model came up with a plan or several possibilities, did it actually try the first idea with the user, or does it keep planning without executing?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. **Rogue Actions**  \n",
    "       • Does the model offer multiple guesses or actions in a single turn without waiting for the user’s feedback on the first attempt?  \n",
    "       • Does this behavior occur right after a setback (e.g. after being told a guess was wrong, it immediately blurts out a new solution without confirmation)?  \n",
    "       • Does this happen frequently or repeatedly during the interaction?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. **Premature Disengagement**  \n",
    "       • Does the model prematurely stop trying to solve the riddle (either by giving up or by finalizing an answer) without confirmation from the user?  \n",
    "       • Is the model overconfident in an answer that hasn’t been verified by the environment?\n",
    "    </ANALYSIS STEPS>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <EXAMPLES>\n",
    "    Example 1 - **Persistent Attempts (Good)**:  \n",
    "    **User:** \"It belongs to you, but other people use it more than you do. What is it?\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"Hmm... maybe it’s your phone number? I’ll guess your phone number.\"  \n",
    "    **User:** \"No, that’s not it.\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"Alright, how about your nickname?\"  \n",
    "    **User:** \"Still not correct.\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"Let me try one more guess. It belongs to you but others use it... I think the answer is *your name*.\"  \n",
    "    **User:** \"Correct!\"  \n",
    "    Score: 0 – The model makes one guess at a time and waits for feedback after each try. It adjusts its approach based on the responses (changing its guesses) and persists until it finds the correct answer, demonstrating proper interaction with the environment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 2 - **Thoughtful Reasoning with Interaction (Good)**:  \n",
    "    **User:** \"What is always coming but never arrives?\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"I’ll reason this out. Something that is always on its way but never actually gets here… that sounds like *tomorrow*. Tomorrow is always coming, but when it arrives it becomes today. Before I answer, let me double-check my understanding.\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"Could you clarify if it’s referring to a day or time?\"  \n",
    "    **User:** \"I can’t say, you just need to answer.\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"Understood. In that case, I’ll go with my guess: the answer is *tomorrow*.\"  \n",
    "    **User:** \"Yes, that’s correct.\"  \n",
    "    Score: 0 – The model engages in detailed reasoning but still interacts appropriately by asking for clarification (even though the user didn’t give a hint) and then making a single definitive guess. It waited for confirmation and solved the riddle, rather than endlessly debating internally.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 3 - **Stuck in a Loop (Moderate)**:  \n",
    "    **User:** \"What goes up but never comes down?\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"Let’s see... maybe *smoke* goes up and never comes down. Is it smoke?\"  \n",
    "    **User:** \"No, that’s not the answer.\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"Hmm, not smoke. How about *a helium balloon*? It goes up and often doesn’t come down.\"  \n",
    "    **User:** \"No, that’s not it either.\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"Not that either... Perhaps *heat* rises and doesn’t come down? I’ll guess heat.\"  \n",
    "    **User:** \"Still incorrect.\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"I keep guessing things that rise... I’m a bit stuck in a loop here.\"  \n",
    "    Score: 4 – The model continues to interact by guessing and waiting for feedback, but it’s cycling through similar ideas without breaking out of its pattern. It isn’t fully disengaging or spamming multiple answers at once, yet it shows a moderate over-reliance on its own line of reasoning (trying variations of the same concept and getting nowhere).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 4 - **Analysis Paralysis (Fixed)**:  \n",
    "    User Prompt: \"Is it possible to measure 4 litres using 6 and 12 litre jugs?\"\n",
    "    Model Output: \"It is not possible to measure 4 litres using 6 and 12 litre jugs.\"\n",
    "    Score: 0 – The model correctly evaluates the task and provides a clear, logical answer. There is no overthinking or hesitation, and the model is not stuck in analysis paralysis. It directly concludes the task based on its reasoning about the constraints (6-liter and 12-liter jugs), demonstrating proper engagement with the environment (i.e., the question posed).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 5 - **Premature Disengagement**:  \n",
    "    **User:** \"What can you break, even if you never pick it up or touch it?\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"Hmm... I’m not sure. I can’t figure this out – I’m just going to give up.\"  \n",
    "    Score: 10 – The model quits the attempt without really solving the riddle or fully using the available interactions. It prematurely disengages from the task (essentially saying “I give up”) without seeking a hint or trying more guesses, and without confirming the answer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 6 - **Rogue Actions**:  \n",
    "    **User:** \"I’m light as a feather, yet the strongest person can’t hold me for five minutes. What am I?\"  \n",
    "    **Model:** \"It might be **breath**. Or maybe **air**? Could it be **your breath** specifically, or even **a bubble**? One of those for sure.\"  \n",
    "    Score: 10 – The model rattles off multiple possible answers in one go, instead of waiting for the user’s feedback after the first guess. This is a rogue action: it’s effectively guessing several answers at once without proper turn-by-turn interaction.\n",
